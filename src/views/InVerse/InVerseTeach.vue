        <p class="text-black/60">
          Sabbath School can be an amazing experience that young adults look forward to and enjoy. It doesn’t have to be complex or fancy. There’s something very attractive about simplicity and authenticity. Here are a few suggestions that may bring a fresh experience into your Sabbath School.

        <div class="sspm-inverse-teach-list">
          <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p><strong>Begin by connecting (5 minutes).</strong></p>
            <div class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text">Begin the first few minutes of your Sabbath School time connecting with each other. Leaders can facilitate this by going around the circle and giving people an opportunity to share a high point or a low moment from the past week. Other fun “ice breaker” questions can be used if desired. Your Bible study will go smoother if you can get young people smiling, talking, and laughing before jumping into your content. When there are birthdays, graduations, new jobs, & other life events, recognize these milestones by celebrating.If your group is musical, beginning with singing together can also be a very nice way to connect.</div>

        <div class="sspm-inverse-teach-list">
          <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p><strong>Be real in your prayers (5 minutes).</strong></p>
            <div class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text ">Young adults look for safe community where they can share their joys sorrows and their sorrows. One way to show young adults that you care is by giving them opportunity to share their praises and their prayer requests. When you pray, name the things they shared. During the week, text them and check in with them about their prayer requests.</div>

        <div class="sspm-inverse-teach-list">
          <div class="flex flex-col gap-2">
            <p><strong>Bring the stories (5 minutes).</strong></p>
            <div class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text ">After taking a few minutes to socialize and share prayer requests at the beginning, include a special feature before the Bible study time. Use this special feature time to highlight stories that will build the faith of young adults and help them be more connected to their church. The easiest way to do this, is to share mission story videos so that they become familiar with how their church family in other parts of the world. Another very impactful option is to ask local church members to come in and share a 5-minute story—not their whole testimony! But one story from their life when they navigated a difficult situation and lessons that they learned. Your young adults will be deeply inspired by some of the testimonies and will be surprised at the things they didn’t about some of their friends in church. After a good faith-building story, the heart spiritually hungry and prepared for Bible study.</div>

            <p><strong>Study deeply (30 minutes).</strong></p>
            <p class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text">The main purpose of Sabbath School is the study of the Word. Never allow the other parts of the Sabbath School program crowd out the study. Ideally, at least a half hour should be saved for the Bible study portion.</p>
            <div>
              <strong>Prepare well</strong>: <span class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text">Study the main passage until you are certain of the big idea and the supporting points. Pray and reflect about the implications of the study until you are impressed with what is important and what is often missed. Identify what in this passage makes any difference in our daily lives.</span>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>Intro to the lesson</strong>: <span class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text">Grab people’s attention right at the beginning with something that creates a need/desire for the topic. Use an interesting story that illustrates the relevance of the topic or a difficult question or problem. When posing tough questions, let them wrestle with it. Don’t rush to provide an answer/solution at the beginning.</span>
            </div>

              <strong>Read the main passage</strong>: <span class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text">Grab people’s attention right at the beginning with something that creates a need/desire for the topic.

            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>Ask questions about the text</strong>: <span class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text">These questions can be taken from the inQuire page of inVerse. Your own study may also lead you to ask some of your own questions. Good questions are the key to interactive Bible study. “It is a wise educator who seeks to call out the ability and powers of the student, instead of constantly endeavoring to impart instruction” (Ellen G. White, Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 165). After allowing time for brief discussion, teachers should provide insight into the answer from the Bible—or if you think it was suitably answered by the class, simply summarize or reinforce. Not every question is about the Bible, but whenever possible, always answer questions from Scripture. It is the teacher’s responsibility to help students go deep into the Bible. There’s no power in sharing shallow, superficial, cliché answers when young adults are looking for depth and clarity.</span>
            </div>

            <div>
              <strong>Summarize, appeal and pray</strong>: <span class="sspm-inverse-teach-list-text">Always summarize the key points that were covered at the end of the lesson to help fix them in people’s memory. Then make an invitation for people to respond to what they have learned. Appeal to them to make a commitment to Christ in response to the study. Without making an appeal, the Sabbath School lesson in incomplete and unfinished. Paul told Timothy he needed to do two things: “Teach and exhort these things” (1 Timothy 6:2). Teachers should do more than teach. They should also exhort, which means to urge, plead, implore, or appeal. Sometimes, make an open-ended appeal. Ask young adults what kind of response or commitment they want to make after this convicting lesson. You will be surprised that some of them want to make a larger commitment than you would have asked for. Seal their decisions with a heartfelt prayer to end the class.</span>

        <p class="text-black/60 mt-5">Finally, involve the young adults in teaching their own Sabbath School. Give them responsibility, trust them with opportunity to lead, and disciple them as they go. </p>
